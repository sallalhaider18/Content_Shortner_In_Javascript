const text = 'This is a sample text that you have asked for.  You just said that you are going to listen to a song. Amar is not talking and not really making any sense to me. He says weird stuff and that is quite not good for someone working in this company. I am not pleased with the level of humor of some people. The varying sense of humor does not allow everyone to enjoy the talking and working. There is a meeting going on in the meeting room and although they are a full team with a tech stack and all, they can not figure out how to start the LED. They cannot make the connection with the laptop and that is strange to say the least.';
